# ECE385-Final-Project
Fish Hunter on FPGA (ECE 385 Final Project)

Xinglong Sun and Churan He

Built a complex graphics game, Fish Hunter, on the FPGA board DE2-115 in SystemVerilog, C, and Python.
•Designed and coded a drawing system in SystemVerilog that could output complex graphics pre-stored in SRAM to the VGA monitor.
•Accomplished complicated game logic and mathematical computations in C on NIOS II soft processor
•Wrote helper code in Python to facilitate design process. Examples include a "compresser" using KMeans Clustering that could compress a photo to a color palette with given number of colors, a "generator" that could mass-produce code with simple logic in SystemVerilog syntax from Python, etc.
